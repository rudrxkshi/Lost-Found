## 📌 Problem Statement

On a college campus, students frequently lose personal belongings such as ID cards, documents, electronics, and accessories.  
Currently, there is no centralized and reliable system to report or find these items. Information is usually shared through informal channels like WhatsApp groups or word of mouth, which is inefficient, unorganized, and often unsuccessful.

## 💡 Solution Overview

The Lost & Found web application provides a centralized digital platform where students can report and view lost and found items.

Users can submit item details such as:
- Category  
- Location  
- Description  

All data is stored in real time using Firebase. The application supports easy browsing, category-based filtering, and detailed item views, making the recovery process faster and more organized.
